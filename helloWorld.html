    <h1>A Journey</h1>
    <p>This is Day 1 of a Journey. I don't know where I will take it, I don't know where it will take me. I am commiting to 365 days of writing software. I am a builder and it's about time I got to work</p>

console.log('Hello World')

//Until I figure where to take this, I'd do random algos
//Day 1 - Fibonaci Sequence - Each number in a fibonaci sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers

// let n = [0,1]

// for (let index = 0; index < 18; index++) {
//     n.push(n[n.length-1]+n[n.length-2])
    
// }


// console.log(n);

//Day 2 - Algo to find random number in an ordered sequence btw 1-100 in shortest time
 let random = 10
 //allow user type it

for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
    const element = array[index];
